# MEET-U Project

Team members: Isabelle Wu, Birsu Guzel, Brenda Enriquez and Emilie Doan

## Our data

3 files :
- pilot_library.csv : contains more than 5000 potential ligands that could inhibit nsp13 (given by sorbonne. Their features are known.
- ligand_papers.csv : contains ligands that can fix the ATP or RNA pocket, and are verified by the litterature. But we don't know their features.
- 

## Our goal

To find fixation classifier of ligands by using Molzip to reduce the size of our database.


## Molzip

Promising. 

Unconventional method based on the information theory. This method can predict different features relatively well based on the compression rate (Gzip). We accurately predict the solubility rate of different ligands and compared it to real solubility. We think that we can also use it to get other features as molecular weight, blabla...

... promising.


## Neural Network

Promising.
